Introduction to Zii view widgets
=====================

In Yii, the view widgets are extremely useful, but haven't been that well documented.
In essense, view widgets take data that has been prepackaged in a data provider class
and then renders the data in a table or list of some kind.

The widget loops over each row of data in the provider and also gives you total control
of which data columns you want to show (and how they should be formatted / presented).
A column usually represents an attribute of your data item.  But some columns may correspond
to complex expressions of attributes or static text.

There are several different types of grid view widgets that come with Yii.

CGridView
=================

`CGridView` works much like a spreadsheet with filters.  It displays data in columnar form
and supports both sorting and searching on column values. `CGridView` should be used with
a data provider (such as `CActiveDataProvider`).

The minimal code needed to use CGridView is as follows:

~~~
$dataProvider=new CActiveDataProvider('Post');

$this->widget('zii.widgets.grid.CGridView', array(
    'dataProvider'=>$dataProvider,
));
~~~

The above code first creates a data provider for the Post ActiveRecord class.
It then uses `CGridView` to display every attribute in every Post instance.
The displayed table is equipped with sorting and pagination functionality.

A more functional grid might look something like this:
~~~
$this->widget('zii.widgets.grid.CGridView', array(
    'dataProvider'=>$dataProvider,
    'columns'=>array(
        'title',          // display the 'title' attribute
        'category.name',  // display the 'name' attribute of the 'category' relation
        'content:html',   // display the 'content' attribute as purified HTML
        array(            // display 'create_time' using an expression
            'name'=>'create_time',
            'value'=>'date("M j, Y", $data->create_time)',
        ),
        'updated_time:datetime:Updated', // displays the updated time formatted using CFormatter
        							 // with the header Updated
        array(            // display 'author.username' using an expression
            'name'=>'authorName',
            'value'=>'$data->author->username',
        ),
        array(            // display a column with "view", "update" and "delete" buttons
            'class'=>'CButtonColumn',
        ),
    ),
));
~~~

See [grid-columns] for details about how to configure different columns.

CListView
=================

`CListView` displays data in a list, but can be easily customized to display multiple items per row.
It works quite well for displaying data along with images (such as search results) instead of in
a strictly column/row fashion as required in `CGridView`. However, the standard perks that come with
`CGridView` also apply to `CListView`.  Sorting, filtering, pagination and the like still work, as they
are all inherited from `CBaseListView`.

The minimal code needed to use CListView is as follows:

~~~
$dataProvider=new CActiveDataProvider('Post');

$this->widget('zii.widgets.CListView', array(
    'dataProvider'=>$dataProvider,
    'itemView'=>'_post',   // refers to the partial view named '_post'
    'sortableAttributes'=>array(
        'title',
        'create_time'=>'Post Time',
    ),
));
~~~

~~~
// _post.php
<div class="post">
	<b><?php echo CHtml::encode($data->getAttributeLabel('title')); ?>:</b>
	<?php echo CHtml::encode($data->title); ?><br />

	<b><?php echo CHtml::encode($data->getAttributeLabel('body')); ?>:</b>
	<?php echo CHtml::encode($data->body); ?><br />
	
</div>
~~~

The above code uses a data provider for the Post ActiveRecord class and then loops over the posts
using the `_view.php` as the template.  Each row is passed in and is represented by $data. In this
case, we can use `$data` just like a Post object, but if using `CArrayDataProvider` or `CSqlDataProvider`,
`$data` would be an array instead.

CDetailView
=================

`CDetailView` displays data in a table, but is designed to display info about just one object / array.
It works well for display information about a specific item. Sorting, filtering and pagination don't apply
in this case, so it's main use is to ease setup of information.  When combined with the power of the [columns
system](), it grows powerful quite quickly.

Typical usage of CDetailView is as follows:

~~~
$this->widget('zii.widgets.CDetailView', array(
    'data'=>$model,
    'attributes'=>array(
        'title',             // title attribute (in plain text)
        'owner.name',        // an attribute of the related object "owner"
        'description:html',  // description attribute in HTML
        array(               // related city displayed as a link
            'label'=>'City',
            'type'=>'raw',
            'value'=>CHtml::link(CHtml::encode($model->city->name),
                                 array('city/view','id'=>$model->city->id)),
        ),
    ),
));
~~~

The above code uses a data provider for the Post ActiveRecord class and then loops over the posts
using the `_view.php` as the template.  Each row is passed in and is represented by $data. In this
case, we can use `$data` just like a Post object, but if using `CArrayDataProvider` or `CSqlDataProvider`,
`$data` would be an array instead.

Pagination, sorting and filtering
========
All view widgets support pagination of data making it quite easy to handle large amounts of
data that need to be split across multiple pages.  Pagination can be done either with AJAX or
with normal page requests. If a user has disabled JavaScript, sorting and pagination will
downgrade and still work as expected.

Pagination, sorting and filtering are all done at the `CDataProvider` level.  See the [data providers] page
for more info.
