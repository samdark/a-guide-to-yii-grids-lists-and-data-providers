Data providers
==============

Data provider abstracts getting data by providing `IDataProvider` interface and
handles pagination and sorting.

It can be used by grids, lists and all other classes extended from
`CBaseListView` as well as in custom code.

In Yii there are three default data providers: `CActiveDataProvider`, `CArrayDataProvider`
and `CSqlDataProvider`.

Active data provider
--------------------

`CActiveDataProvider` implements a data provider based on ActiveRecord.

Array data provider
-------------------

`CArrayDataProvider` implements a data provider based on a raw data array.

SQL data provider
-----------------

`CSqlDataProvider` implements a data provider based on a plain SQL statement.

Data provider Iterator
-----------------
`CDataProviderIterator`, a new class as of 1.1.13, should be used if you are dealing with large amounts of data. The data providers above all pull the entire dataset and then iterate over it.  This does something different.  Elaborate :-)
